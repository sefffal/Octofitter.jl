If your orbit already has several relative astrometry or RV data points, this is less of an issue. But in many cases it is recommended to use the Pigeons.jl sampler instead of Octofitter's default. This sampler is less efficient for unimodal distributions, but is more robust at exploring posteriors with distinct, widely separated peaks.
