Octofitter is a Julia package for performing Bayesian inference 
against a wide variety of exoplanet / binary star data.
You can also use Octofitter from Python using the [Python guide](@ref python).

!!! warning "Upgrading from v6?"
    **If you're upgrading from Octofitter v6, please see our [Migration Guide](@ref migration) for help updating your code to the new v7 API.**

**Supported data:**
* Fit exoplanet orbits to relative astrometry
* Fit radial velocity data (relative between a companion and host, and absolute)
* Model stellar activity with Gaussian processes
* Model stellar astrometric accerlation (Gaia-Hipparcos proper motion anomaly, Hipparcos IAD)
* "De-orbiting": combine a sequence of images with orbital motion to detect planets
* Sample directly from images or interferometric visibilities
* Experimental support for transit data based on Transits.jl

You can freely combine any of the above data types.  Any and all combinations work together.

**Modelling features:**
* multiple planets (zero or more)
* hyperbolic orbits
* co-planar, and non-coplanar systems
* arbitrary priors and parameterizations
* optional O'Neil "observable based priors"
* link mass to photometry via atmosphere models
* hierarchical models (with a bit of work from the user)

**Speed:**

Fit astrometry on your laptop in seconds!

* Highly optimized code and derivatives are generated from your model
* Higher order sampler (No U-Turn sampler) which explores the parameter space very efficiently 
* The sampler is automatically warmed up using a variational approximation from the Pathfinder algorithm (Pathfinder.jl) 

Multi-body physics is not currently supported. A Pull-request to PlanetOrbits.jl implementing this functionality would be welcome.
