Octofitter is a Julia package for performing Bayesian inference 
against a wide variety of exoplanet / binary star data.
You can also use Octofitter from Python using the [Python guide](@ref python).

!!! warning "Upgrading from v6?"
    **If you're upgrading from Octofitter v6 or below, please see our [Migration Guide](@ref migration)**

**Supported data:**
Fit exoplanet orbits to
* relative astrometry
* absolute astrometry (Gaia or Hipparcos)
* absolute radial velocity data (of a star)
* relative radial velocity data (of a planet relative to a star)
* sample directly from images (also known as "deorbiting")
* sample directly from interferometric visibilities (NIRISS-AMI, or GRAVITY)

You can freely combine any of the above data types.  Any and all combinations work together.

**Modelling features:**
* multiple planets (zero or more)
* gaussian processes (AbstractGPs or Celerite)
* hyperbolic orbits
* co-planar, and non-coplanar systems
* arbitrary priors and parameterizations
* optional O'Neil "observable based priors"
* link mass to photometry via atmosphere models
* hierarchical models (with a bit of work from the user)
* Model stellar activity with Gaussian processes

**Speed:**

Fit astrometry on your laptop in seconds!

* Highly optimized code and derivatives are generated from your model
* Higher order sampler (No U-Turn sampler) which explores the parameter space very efficiently 
* The sampler is automatically warmed up using a variational approximation from the Pathfinder algorithm (Pathfinder.jl)
